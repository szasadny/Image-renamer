# 📸 Image Renamer & Date Adjuster

This batch script automates the process of renaming image files and adjusting their `FileCreateDate` and `FileModifyDate` metadata using [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/). It scans specified subdirectories, renames images sequentially, and adjusts timestamps with random increments. Ideal for organizing photo sets while maintaining chronological order and adjusting timestamps incrementally for unique date data.
